# Civilization Broadcast

It allows you to send a broadcast message to all servers on MultiPaper. Cross-compatible with Paper.

Broadcast sent will:
- Show up in chat
- Show up as subtitle in middle of players screen
- Show up in console

This happens on each server node.

## Usage

- `/civbroadcast` or `/civbroadcast help` - see all commands
- `/civbroadcast debug` - see if multipaper is detected
- `/civbroadcast broadcast <message>` - send specified message cross-server
